The threat actors sent the trojanized Microsoft Word documents, probably via email. Talos discovered a document named
MinutesofMeeting-2May19.docx. 
Once the victim opens the document, it fetches a remove template from the actor-controlled website, hxxp://droobox[.]online:80/luncher.doc. Once the luncher.doc was downloaded, it used CVE-2017-11882, to execute code
on the victim's machine. 
After the exploit, the file would write a series of base64-encoded PowerShell commands that acted as a stager and set up persistence by adding it to the HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run Registry key.

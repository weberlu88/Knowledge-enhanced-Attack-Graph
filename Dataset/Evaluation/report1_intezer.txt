RedXOR uses an open-source LKM rootkit called “Adore-ng” to hide its process. Embedding open-source LKM rootkits is a common Winnti technique.The malware checks if the rootkit is active by creating a file and removing it. Then, the malware compares the “saved set-user-ID” of the process to the user ID. If they don’t match, the rootkit is enabled. As part of its persistence methods, RedXOR attempts to create a service under rc.d. The developer added “S99” before the name of the service to lower its priority and make it run last on system initiation.
